# Fitness Function
Same as the quadruped: continue in the negative direction as negative as possible

# Design
I wanted to make a design that I thought would be more effective than a quadruped at clearing flat ground. 

Therefore, I designed an "animal" that was shaped closer to a millipede, and had a cleft in the middle in order for legs to never get too stuck. 

In the end, it seems to move slowly but consistently, like a millipede, but the leg movements back and forth seem to interfere with each other, though my attempts to circumvent this were unsuccessful.
